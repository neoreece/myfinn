The aim of this project is to provide a financial management application that
makes it easier for college graduates to manage their student debts and loans.

In addition, this program serves as a portfolio item to demonstrate my ability
to use a mySQL database, make use of existing libraries to make a GUI, and
to follow the engineering design process to produce a reliable product with
all of the necessary documentation to make management and future revisions
easier to implement.
